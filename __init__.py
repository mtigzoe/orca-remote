"""Orca Remote user extension -- package entry point.

Released Orca (51.1) loads a directory in
~/.local/share/orca/extensions/ as an extension package, and reads its
metadata by *parsing* this file. Its reader only accepts a class whose
base is literally named `Extension`, and it takes GROUP_LABEL /
DESCRIPTION / VERSION / AUTHOR / WEBSITE from literal assignments in
that class body. With nothing to find, Orca's extension list shows the
package as "Invalid" and never loads it -- so the class below must stay
a real ClassDef with literal metadata, and its base must keep the name
`Extension` (hence the alias). A plain re-export is not enough.

Newer Orca builds use the manifest.toml entry (entry.module = "remote",
entry.class = "RemoteExtension") and never execute this file. Both
loaders end up with the same RemoteExtension implementation.
